## What is this?

This is the beginning of a Protocol.IO Desktop and mobile application. It relies upon the protocolsioapi NPM package.


## Quickstart

Clone this repository and create a settings.json file like so.

```json
	{
		"protocolsio_api_key": "YOURAPIKEYHERE"
	}	
```

Then simply run this project from the app directory with the settings.json file.


So all in all

```
	git clone https://github.com/ethanwillis/ProtocolsIOApp
	cd ProtocolsIOApp
	## Make settings.json file.
	cd app
	meteor --settings=../settings.json
```
